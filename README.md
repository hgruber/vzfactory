# vzfactory
use a Dockerfile to create an OpenVZ Image without docker

* Your production runs OpenVZ containers and your developers like docker. 
* You think docker is not ready for your production but you love automated docker builds

then this is perhaps for you: vzfactory creates an OpenVZ container from a simple Dockerfile in an OpenVZ-only environment.
